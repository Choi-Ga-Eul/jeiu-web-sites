                    JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly 
                    typed, prototype-based, multi=paradigm, and interpreted programming language.
                    Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core techonlogies
                    of World Wide WEb content production. It is used to make webpages interactive
                    and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites 
                    employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins
                    by means of a built-in JavaSCript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines
                    represent a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript
                    specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many 
                    engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
